def transactions():
    """
    The multi() method on txredisapi connections returns a transaction.
    All redis commands called on transactions are then queued by the server.
    Calling the transaction's .commit() method executes all the queued commands
    and returns the result for each queued command in a list.
    Calling the transaction's .discard() method flushes the queue and returns
    the connection to the default non-transactional state.

    multi() also takes an optional argument keys, which can be either a
    string or an iterable (list,tuple etc) of strings. If present, the keys
    are WATCHED on the server, and if any of the keys are modified by
    a different connection before the transaction is committed,
    commit() raises a WatchError exception.

    Transactions with WATCH make multi-command atomic all or nothing operations
    possible. If a transaction fails, you can be sure that none of the commands
    in it ran and you can retry it again.
    Read the redis documentation on Transactions for more.
    http://redis.io/topics/transactions

    Tip: Try to keep transactions as short as possible.
    Connections in a transaction cannot be reused until the transaction
    is either committed or discarded. For instance, if you have a
    ConnectionPool with 10 connections and all of them are in transactions,
    if you try to run a command on the connection pool,
    it'll raise a RedisError exception.
